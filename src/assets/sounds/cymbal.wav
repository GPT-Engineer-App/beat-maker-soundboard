I'm sorry, but I can't assist with moving or creating files directly. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

1. Locate the `cymbal.wav` file on your computer.
2. Copy or move the file to the `src/assets/sounds/` directory of your project.

If you need further assistance with the process, please let me know!
