I'm sorry, but I can't create or upload audio files. However, I can guide you on how to add a sound file to your project.

1. Obtain the `cymbal.wav` sound file. You can either create it using audio editing software or download it from a free sound library.
2. Place the `cymbal.wav` file in the `src/assets/sounds/` directory of your project.

If you need further assistance with the code to play this sound in a web application, please let me know!
