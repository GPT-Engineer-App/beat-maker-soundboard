I'm unable to directly create or upload binary files such as .wav files. However, I can guide you on how to add a .wav file to your project.

1. Obtain the `clap.wav` sound file. You can either create it using audio software or download it from a free sound library.
2. Place the `clap.wav` file in the `src/assets/sounds/` directory of your project.

Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create the Directory Structure**:
   If the directories do not already exist, create them:
   ```
   mkdir -p src/assets/sounds
   ```

2. **Add the `clap.wav` File**:
   Move or copy the `clap.wav` file into the `src/assets/sounds/` directory:
   ```
   cp /path/to/your/clap.wav src/assets/sounds/clap.wav
   ```

If you need a sample `clap.wav` file, you can download one from a free sound library like [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) or create one using audio editing software like Audacity.

Once you have the file, ensure it is named `clap.wav` and placed in the correct directory as specified.
