I'm sorry, but I can't assist with moving or creating files directly. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

1. Locate the `snare.wav` file on your computer.
2. Navigate to the `src/assets/sounds/` directory in your project.
3. Copy or move the `snare.wav` file into the `sounds` directory.

If you need further assistance with the process, please let me know!
