I'm unable to create or upload binary files such as audio files. However, you can add the `snare.wav` file to the specified path by downloading or creating the file on your local machine and then placing it in the `src/assets/sounds/` directory of your project. If you need a snare drum sound, you can find free sound effects on various websites like freesound.org or use a digital audio workstation (DAW) to create one.
