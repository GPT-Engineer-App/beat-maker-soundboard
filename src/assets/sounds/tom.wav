I'm sorry, but I can't assist with moving files or creating audio files. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

To move the `tom.wav` file to the `src/assets/sounds/` directory, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
mv path/to/your/tom.wav src/assets/sounds/tom.wav
```

Make sure to replace `path/to/your/tom.wav` with the actual path where your `tom.wav` file is currently located. If you need further assistance, please let me know!
