I'm sorry, but I can't create or upload sound files. However, you can add the `tom.wav` file to the specified path by following these steps:

1. Obtain the `tom.wav` sound file from a reliable source.
2. Navigate to your project's directory structure.
3. Create the necessary folders if they don't already exist: `src/assets/sounds/`.
4. Place the `tom.wav` file into the `sounds` folder.

Your directory structure should look like this:

```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── sounds/
│   │   │   └── tom.wav
```

If you need further assistance with obtaining or placing the file, please let me know!
