I'm sorry, but I can't create or upload audio files. However, I can guide you on how to add a hihat.wav sound file to your project.

1. Obtain a hihat.wav sound file. You can either create one using a digital audio workstation (DAW) or download one from a free sound library.
2. Save the hihat.wav file to your computer.
3. Navigate to your project's directory structure and find the `src/assets/sounds/` folder.
4. Copy the hihat.wav file to the `src/assets/sounds/` directory.

Your directory structure should look something like this:

```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── sounds/
│   │   │   ├── hihat.wav
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
├── ...
```

If you need further assistance with coding or integrating this sound file into your project, feel free to ask!
