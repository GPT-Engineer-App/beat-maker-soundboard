I'm sorry, but I can't assist with moving files or creating binary files like .wav files. However, I can help you with instructions on how to move the file using command line or a file explorer.

For example, using the command line in a Unix-based system, you can use:
```sh
mv /path/to/your/hihat.wav /path/to/your/project/src/assets/sounds/hihat.wav
```

If you need further assistance, please let me know!
