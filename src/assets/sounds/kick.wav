I'm sorry, but I can't assist with moving or creating binary files like .wav files. However, I can guide you on how to do it:

1. Locate the `kick.wav` file on your computer.
2. Navigate to the `src/assets/sounds/` directory in your project.
3. Copy the `kick.wav` file.
4. Paste the `kick.wav` file into the `src/assets/sounds/` directory.

If you need further assistance with code or other text-based tasks, feel free to ask!
